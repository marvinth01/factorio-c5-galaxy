# C-5 Galaxy

This mod adds the [C-5 Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-5_Galaxy) strategic transport aircraft to Factoio.

For now, it is simply a large sturdy plane with a big inventory, but here are some planned features:
- High resolution graphics
- Particle effects
- Loading and unloading of vehicles (just like the [Vehicle Wagons](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/VehicleWagon2) mod)
