# C-5 Galaxy

![Mod thumbnail](/c5-galaxy/thumbnail.png)

This mod adds the [C-5 Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-5_Galaxy) strategic transport aircraft to Factoio.

It is a large sturdy plane with a big inventory, with these additional features:
- Realistic takeoff & landing mechanics
- **Autopilot**: Specify takeoff & landing runways, ground taxi waypoints, and parking markers!

I might also add these things in the future if I have the time:
- High resolution graphics
- Particle effects
- Loading and unloading of vehicles (just like the [Vehicle Wagons](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/VehicleWagon2) mod)
